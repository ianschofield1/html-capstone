<h1>My Favorite Hobbies!</h1>
<h2>Soccer</h2>
<p>
  Soccer is one of my favorite activities to do and it is a sport I grew up
  playing. The technique of the beautiful game always interested me; it is
  simple yet so intricate. I played all throughout my childhood and went on to
  play for my high school team in my teenage years. While I never made it to the
  collegiate/professional level, soccer will always be in my blood and in my
  heart; I encourage anyone that is interested to grab a ball and give it a try!

<h2>Chess</h2>
<p>
  Much like soccer, this game involves a certain complexity aspect that creates
  an addicting environment for those who indulge. I enjoy playing others in my
  spare time, and learning more about new openings and middle game strategies.
  It is truly a beautiful game that keeps the mind extremely focused on the
  objective.

<h2>Listening to Podcasts</h2>
<p>
  Pdocasts are enjoyable for me, as they provide an easily accessible way to
  learn new information. Whether I am driving from home to my job, or taking a
  long trip down to South Carolina, podcasts are a great way of finding
  relaxation whilst obtaining new information. There are also a wide variety of
  genres and subjects, so the options to listen to your desired subject are
  limitless!
